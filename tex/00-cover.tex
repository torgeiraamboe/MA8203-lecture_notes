\section*{About}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{About}
These lecture notes are based on my notes from the course MA8203 - Algebraic geometry taught by Peder Thompson at NTNU during the spring of 2021. The course followed the books \textit{Algebraic geometry} by Perrin and \textit{Algebraic geometry} by Hartshorne, hence these notes also have a similar progression. There are probably some mistakes in these notes, so take what is here with a pinch of salt, but most should hopefully be correct. 

If you find mistakes you want corrected, or have some notes on my notes, then feel free to suggest changes and additions at \href{https://github.com/torgeiraamboe/MA8203-lecture_notes}{the github repo}. Feel free to use any figures or text in that repo for whatever you need.
