\section*{About}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{About}
These are my notes from the course MA8203 - Algebraic geometry taught by Peder Thompson at NTNU during the spring of 2021. There are probably some mistakes in these notes, so take what is here with a pinch of salt, but most should be correct. In the future I might try to convert the drawings into actual \TeX{}  figures (work in progress), but for now these epic hand-drawn ones will have to do. 

If you find mistakes you want corrected, or have some notes on my notes, then feel free to contact me.
