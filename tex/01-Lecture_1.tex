\section{Lecture 1 - 12.01.21}

\subsection{Administrative information and setup}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Treat classes over zoom as a normal class.
    \item We will meet Mondays and Tuesdays from 10.15 to 12.00. Classes will not be recorded.
    \item The exam will be oral, possibly digital.
    \item It will be based on what is done in class, so if one wants to take the exam one should be present in most classes. The focus on the exam will be on the problems given throughout the course.
    \item The course will somewhat closely follow the book \textit{Algebraic Geometry - An introduction} by Daniel Perrin.  
\end{itemize}



Algebraic geometry is the study of algebraic varieties, which are roughly the zero loci of polynomials over fields. It is an old theory, spanning way back, but the focus of this course will be on the more modern theory developed by the likes of J.P. Serre and A. Grothendieck during the last half of the 20'th century. 

Throughout the course $k$ will be a field, usually algebraically closed, or at least infinite. The motivating examples will be $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{R}$. We will start by studying affine algebraic varieties, and later projective varieties, which are locally modeled by the affine ones. 

\subsection{Introduction}

Let $P\in k[X_1, \ldots X_n]$, i.e. a polynomial in $n$ variables over a field $k$. Define its zero locus to be the set $V(P) = \{ x\in k^n \vert P(x)=0 \}\subset k^n$. This set $V(P)$ is roughly what we mean by an algebraic variety. More generally we can use a set of polynomials instead of just one. Let $P=\{ P_i\}$ be a collection of polynomials in $k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$. We define the zero locus of the polynomials to be $V(P) = \{ x\in k^n \vert P_i(x)=0, \forall i\}$. 

A subset $X\subset k^n$ is also an affine algebraic variety if $X = V(P)$ for some set of polynomials $P=\{ P_i\}$ in $k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$. Really this is what we call an affine algebraic set, but we will get back to this in lecture 2. 




\subsubsection*{Examples}

\begin{example}
If the $P_i$'s all have degree 1, then $V(P)$ are affine linear subspaces of $k^n$, i.e. liner, planes and hyperplanes. 
\end{example}

Let $n=2$ and $k=\mathbb{R}$. Then the zero locus of a single polynomial $P(X, Y)$ is a real plane curve. 

\begin{example}
An example of such a curve is $P(X, Y) = X-Y$, which has zero locus being the line $f(x)=x$ in the plane, i.e.
\begin{center}

\input{inkscape/line.pdf_tex}
\end{center}
\end{example}


\begin{example}
If we require the polynomial to be of degree 2, then we can have $P(X, Y)=X^2+Y^2-1$, which has zero locus equal to the unit circle in $\mathbb{R}^2$. 
\begin{center}
\def\svgwidth{0.4\textwidth}
\input{inkscape/circle.pdf_tex}
\end{center}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Another example in degree 2 is $P(X, Y) = y-x^2$, which has zero locus equal to the graph of $f(x)=x^2$.
\begin{center}
\def\svgwidth{0.4\textwidth}
\input{inkscape/parable.pdf_tex}
\end{center}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
If we have degree 3 polynomials we have for example $P(X, Y)=Y^2-X^3$ which have zero locus being a cuspidal curve.
\begin{center}
\def\svgwidth{0.4\textwidth}
\input{inkscape/cusp.pdf_tex}
\end{center}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Another degree 3 example is $P(X, Y) = X^3+Y^3 - XY$, which has a loop shaped zero locus. 
\begin{center}
\def\svgwidth{0.4\textwidth}
\input{inkscape/loop.pdf_tex}
\end{center}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
A more famous degree 3 example are elliptic curves, for example
\begin{center}
\def\svgwidth{0.4\textwidth}
\input{inkscape/singular_cubic.pdf_tex}
\end{center}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Some higher degree examples include the trefoil curve, $P(X,Y)=(X^2+Y^2)^2 + 3X^2Y-Y^3$, 
\begin{center}
\def\svgwidth{0.4\textwidth}
\input{inkscape/trefoil.pdf_tex}
\end{center}
    
and the quadrafoil curve $P(X, Y) = (X^2+Y^2)^2-4X^2Y^2$.
\begin{center}
\def\svgwidth{0.4\textwidth}
\input{inkscape/quadrafoil.pdf_tex}
\end{center}
\end{example}

If we let $n=3$ and still have $k=\mathbb{R}$ then the zero loci of single polynomials are surfaces. If we have degree 2 polynomials we get the quadratic surfaces we know from calculus. 

\begin{example}
The most recognized quadratic surface is maybe the zero locus of $P(X, Y, Z) = X^2+Y^2+Z^2-1$, which is equal to the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$
\begin{center}
\def\svgwidth{0.4\textwidth}
\input{inkscape/sphere.pdf_tex}
\end{center}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Another example of a surface is given by $P(X, Y, Z) = X^2+Y^2-Z^2-1$ which has zero locus equal to a hyperboloid.
\begin{center}
\def\svgwidth{0.4\textwidth}
\input{inkscape/hyperboloid.pdf_tex}
\end{center}
\end{example}

Let us still consider $n=3$ and $k=\mathbb{R}$. If we instead of just a single polynomial have two polynomials we get the space-curves as their zero loci. 

\begin{example}
An example is the zero locus $V=\{(x,y,z)\in \mathbb{R}^3 \vert x^2+y^2-z^2-1 = 0, y=0\}$, which is the part of the previous hyperboloid lying in the $xz$-plane
\end{example}

\textbf{Note: } This study depends very much on which field we work in. We mentioned that we are going to mostly assume that our field is algebraically closed. This places an emphasis on the equations defining our varieties, rather than their actual points. 

\subsection{Intersection of curves}
\textbf{Question:} How can two plane curves intersect?

\begin{enumerate}
    \item They can not intersect at all. 
    \item They can be tangent to each other, hence only intersect at a single point. 
    \item They can intersect in some finite number of points.
    \item They can be overlapping, and hence have a continuum of intersections.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Discuss in groups:} How does the number of intersections relate to the degrees of the curves? What are the maximum and minimum number of intersections? What are the special cases, and what is the general behavior?

Let $C$ and $C'$ be plane curves of degrees $d$ and $d'$  respectively. The natural questions that arise is the discussions are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Do $C$ and $C'$ always intersect in at most $dd'$ points?
    \item When is the number of intersection points equal to $dd'$?
\end{itemize}

There are three obstructions to the number of intersections being $dd'$. These are
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The curves have a common component, i.e. they have an infinite number of intersection points
    \item The curves have no overlap, for example two parallel lines
    \item The curves are tangent, and can therefore have less intersection points
\end{enumerate}

\begin{theorem}[BÃ©zouts theorem]
Let $C$ and $C'$ be two projective plane curves of degree $d$ and $d'$, defined over an algebraically closed field, with no common components. Then the number of intersections, counted with multiplicity, is $dd'$.
\end{theorem}

To formalize and prove this theorem is one of the main goals of this course. Notice that the three obstructions are naturally removed in the theorem, because no common components mean we have a finite number of intersections, projective curves mean we don't have parallel lines and counting with multiplicity means tangential curves are counted right.
